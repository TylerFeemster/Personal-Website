<p><strong>Problem:</strong> It's clear that there is something and not
nothing. Why? <strong>Explanation:</strong> The question is not yes vs
no, something vs nothing. The wonder that first provokes the question is
the rich particularity of our life. Why this particular existence and
not just nothing at all?</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> If we reduce every phenomenon to its
fundamental essence, is there not still some particularity that must be
explained? <strong>Explanation:</strong> In other words, there doesn't
seem to be any <em>atomic reasons</em> or natural axioms, <em>a
priori</em>. If this is the underlying goal (to root things in natural
axioms), we should have some conception of what counts as a natural
axiom.</p>
