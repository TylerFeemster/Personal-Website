  From even the steadiest shore, the tides always come and rip us from it. Our fingers, fighting for a firm hold, find only 
  fistfulls of sand as we are sucked mercilessly into the darkest depths. Let go of that stupid sand! It’ll dissolve anyways, 
  falling from the tightest grip to the sea floor, where dead dreams drift before a belated burial. Let it go. All of it. 
  Absolutes are never absolute, just heavy burdens. Absolutes are wings of wax that send us tumbling back to sea, forever back 
  and sometimes forth. There is only one absolute, and it is lighter than air, for it demands nothing, demands it. It is the grace 
  of Nothingness. Nothingness can only be felt on the heights of despair. When we’ve let all the sand vanish from our hands, we are 
  already holding Nothingness. On the heights of despair, we doubt everything, including life itself. This doubt is no symptom. 
  It is the process of letting go of every loose fragment of a broken Somethingness, the process of freeing our hands to swim in 
  the abyss. Sucked under the stormy waters, drowning, Nothingness is the firm hand that levels us, pulling us gently out. Nobody 
  will claim that it brings us to shore, but it brings us to zero, that infinitesimal atom separating the water from the sky, the second primordial separation behind only light and darkness. By internalizing this Nothingness, really embodying it, we walk on water.


  When we can walk on water, what’s the point of returning to shore? With the ripples running underneath our feet, we feel the sea for the 
  first time, its subtle strength. For the first time, we feel our souls, that place of unmoving movement, that dark light. Kitaro Nishida once 
  wrote, “The bottom of my soul has such depth; neither joy nor the waves of sorrow can reach it.” In the depths of the soul lies Nothingness,
  that untouchable psychosis at the root of existence. Psychosis: a graceless form of an otherwise necessary detachment. 


  Nothingness is always a return to Nothingness, a coming home. There is no beyond Nothingness, no before, no after.
