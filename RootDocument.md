[[Career Plan]] and [[Personal Plan]]

Lays out current thoughts, experimental systems, and plans for living true to [[Values]].

### Maintenance
Once per week (with weekly plan), review and refocus on values; create a [[Value Plan]] for the week: what to work on, what to try out. Include mental health strategies.

Maintain *idea notebook* / *digital idea storage system* around these values and plans. Review these in detail when changing values / plans.

## Productivity

Deploy weekly/daily plans.

* **Each week**: Build week based on strategic plans, calendar, task list, and value plan.
* **Each day**: Review weekly and value plans. If weekday, build a time block plan.

Build ritual to tie up work for the day. Build work-nonwork separation.

**Full capture**: At shutdown, process everything left over into systems.
## Discipline

Maintain in [[Career Plan]] and [[Personal Plan]] an evolving list of *core disciplines* (behaviors, habits, activities) to follow strictly. Can track with *metrics* or not.
